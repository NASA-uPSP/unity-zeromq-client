# ZeroMQ in Unity
In this repo you can find two different client implementations of ZeroMQ in Unity, together with their respective server implementations in Python.<br/>
One implements the PUB/SUB pattern and the other the REQ/REP pattern.<br/>

# How to
The Unity project has been created with Unity 2020.1.2f.<br/>
Start the Python server (I suggest to use VS Code) and then play the respective Unity scene. The messages will prompt in the console.
